# Volume Cutter (CEP Panel for Adobe Premiere Pro)

A minimal Adobe CEP extension that adds a dockable panel to Premiere Pro.  
Currently, it displays a threshold input and button that triggers a placeholder script in Premiere.  
This is the starting point for building an automated "cut audio below X dB" tool.

## Features
- Loads as a dockable panel in Premiere Pro.
- Sends user input from HTML/JS UI to ExtendScript (`.jsx`) inside Premiere.
- Easy to extend with audio export and analysis logic.
